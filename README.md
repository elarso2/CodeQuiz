For this week's assingment, we were tasked with creating a quiz, filled with code related questions. This quiz is timed, and as such involves a timer function. For each wrong answer selected by the user, 5-10 seconds are deducted from the timer. Correct answers result in the user's score increasing by 1 point. Once the timer runs out, the quiz ends regardless of whether or not the user completed it, and they are given an end message, their final score, and are prompted to enter their initials to score their score in the "High Scores" data.

The site demo we were given to model is
